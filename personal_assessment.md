## Part A

**Role in project:** full-stack engineer

### Responsibilities
- Wrote all HTML/CSS/JS
- Wrote all models/views/controllers

- Decent amount of front-end experience

### Indispensability
- The only one with Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, and/or JS experience
- Interned at GitHub, so I know it a lot better than most people not in the professional industry
- Have professional experience working on larger projects because of a couple of internships, lots of volunteer experience, and successfully completing Dev Bootcamp

### Team Efforts
- One member never showed up to class and did not make any contributions towards the project
- 

### Preperations for Class
- 

### Incoming Goals
- Learn how to divide work equally in a group
- 

### Lessons Learned
- 

## Part B
- **Preliminary concepts/Tech overview:** Since I was the only one that had full-stack experience, I presented the group with what I thought were our best 2 options: Ruby on Rails or Python + Django. I told everyone the pros and cons of each option and tried to remain unbiased (even though I strongly prefer RoR). Everyone that would be writing code voted on the platform. Since I found Heroku to be the easiest to set up for a Rails project, that's where we decided to host our site. We all shared our skills and experiences, which is how we originally broke down each role of the project. Originally I was supposed to be in charge of only the front-end and help out with the back-end (i.e. the models, controllers, DB/migrations, and core algorithm) and web maintenance (i.e. deploying each iteration and running the migrations), but ended up doing more than that.
- **Group planning:** 
- **Developing software requirements:** After we were assigned into our respective groups, we looked over the project and broke it down into the general/basic requirements. As the quarter progressed, we 
- **Design/choice of software:** 
- **Participation in the group:** I honestly believe that this project would not have been *nearly* as successful as it was without me. While I did not always arrive to class on time, I still showed up for all but one in-class meeting and showed up to all meetings outside of class. I tried my best to voice my thoughts, opinions, and concerns. Since I wrote majority of the code, 
- **Adminstrative website maintenance:**
- **Time management:** I kept a list of remaining tasks for myself sorted by priority. I could (and probably should have) created a new project in GitHub to help everyone keep track of the remaining tasks. But, my ToDo list was broken down into groups (e.g., admin views, user sessions, and navbar design). I also made sure to indicate to myself which tasks/features were absolutely necessary and which ones were nice-to-haves (i.e. on the backlog).
- **Backups/Version Control:** As a previous and incoming GitHub intern, I'm usually very good about committing early and often. I always make sure to set up a git repo for every project that I am a part of. I had lots of Git/GitHub cheatsheets leftover from HackIllinois, which I shared with all of my group members. I also tried my best to teach my group members good git practices like always creating a new branch and opening a new PR for each branch instead of committing and pushing directly to master.
- **Presentation skills:** Regardless of my anxiety, I was able to present my work because I knew that I had accomplished all, if not most, of my goals for the week. I was also proud of my work because I was actually putting my knowledge to use and wrote the majority of the code for the project.
- **Planning and executing a successful project:**
